# 🎵 Relational Database Project: Vinyl Recording Collection

## 📘 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a **group assignment** for the **Database Systems (CST2355)** course during the **Winter 2025 semester** in the **Computer Programming & Analysis Diploma** at **Algonquin College**. The objective was to design and implement a fully functional **relational database system** for managing a **Vinyl Recording Collection** using **Oracle SQL**.

Our solution models the collection of records, artists, genres, and transactions—enabling efficient data entry, querying, reporting, and relationship integrity. The database was also integrated with **Microsoft Access** for user-friendly interaction with the data.

## 👩‍💻 My Role: Backend Developer

As the **Backend Developer**, I was responsible for the **design and implementation** of the entire database architecture. My contributions included:

- 📊 Designing **entity-relationship diagrams** and translating them into normalized relational tables.
- 🧩 Establishing **primary/foreign key relationships** to ensure data integrity.
- 🧠 Creating **views**, **stored procedures**, **triggers**, and **sequences** to support business logic and automation.
- 🔗 Connecting the Oracle database to **MS Access** for front-end data interaction and reporting.
- 🧪 Testing data manipulation scenarios and ensuring consistent behavior across the application.

This role enhanced my skills in **data modeling**, **SQL optimization**, and **enterprise-level database development**.
